# Write a program that repeatedly prompts a user for integer numbers until the user enters 'done'.
Once 'done' is entered, print out the largest and smallest of the numbers. 
If the user enters anything other than a valid number catch it with a try/except and
put out an appropriate message and ignore the number. 
Enter the numbers from the book for problem 5.1 and Match the desired output as shown.

largest = -1
smallest = None
i='done'
while True:
    
	try: 
		num = raw_input("Enter a number: ")
		num1 = int(num)
		if num1>largest:
    		largest=num1
		if smallest is None:
			smallest = num1
		elif num1 <smallest:
			smallest = num1
			
		elif i=='done':
			break
	except:
		
		print 'Invalid input'
        
    

print "Maximum is", largest
print "Minimum is", smallest
