1. Write a program to read through the mbox-short.txt and figure out who has the sent the greatest number of mail messages.
The program looks for 'From ' lines and takes the second word of those lines as the person who sent the mail.
The program creates a Python dictionary that maps the sender's mail address to a count of the number of times they appear in the file. 
After the dictionary is produced, the program reads through the dictionary using a maximum loop to find the most prolific committer.

name = raw_input("Enter file:")
if len(name) < 1 : name = "mbox-short.txt"
handle = open(name)
dct=dict()
bigcount = None
bigword = None
for line in handle:
    if not line.startswith('From '):
        continue
    l1=line.strip()
    l2=l1.split()
    l3=l2[1]
    
    dct[l3]=dct.get(l3,0)+1
for key,val in dct.items():
    if bigcount is None or val>bigcount:
        bigword=key
        bigcount=val
print bigword,bigcount
